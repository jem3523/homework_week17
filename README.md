# homework_week17
This is the week 17 homework assignment.

This assignment required the development of mongoDB/mongoose models and server-side routes.  Please focus on the following two files:

*server.js
*models/workout.js
*models/index.js

NOTE: the original seed files needed to be modified so that the date key-value pairs are sent as dates ... and not as numbers.
